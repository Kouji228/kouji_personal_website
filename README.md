## 🎨 Design Inspiration

The initial concept and structure of this portfolio were inspired by [ubaimutl/react-portfolio](https://github.com/ubaimutl/react-portfolio), an excellent React portfolio template. This project has been significantly modified and rebuilt using Next.js with additional features and customizations to suit my personal needs.

- 🎨 Integrated **Tailwind CSS** alongside Bootstrap
- 📱 Enhanced responsive design and animations
- 🔧 Added TypeScript for type safety
- 🆕 Custom features: project showcase, work timeline, enhanced About page
